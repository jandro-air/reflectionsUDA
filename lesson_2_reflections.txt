Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-- Initializing a repository sets up necessary git files and such to begin tracking your data. You do this to set up the file system to appropriately track everything.

What is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-- The staging area is a chance to look over your work, make sure you have everything you want to commit, before you commit any significant changes. The staging area isnt commiting, you dont have to *COMMIT*
