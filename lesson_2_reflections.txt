<Lesson 2 Reflections>

What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-- Initializing a repository sets up necessary git files and such to begin tracking your data. You do this to set up the file system to appropriately track everything.

What is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-- The staging area is a chance to look over your work, make sure you have everything you want to commit, before you commit any significant changes. The staging area isnt commiting, you dont have to *COMMIT*

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-- you can check the staging area to see what will be in the next commit. So if the staging area is all set (everything in you want to commit)

What are some situation when branched would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would some branches help?
-- Branches are great for working on the same project (the tree) but making changes or moving the project in a new direction. an example could be testing a new feature or layout that you don't want as part of the main code base.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-- the diagrams show the branch structure, explaining how the same tree (trunk/master) can have branches that reach for different goals
