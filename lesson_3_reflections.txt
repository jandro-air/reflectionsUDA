Lesson 3 Reflekshuns

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-- using a temporary machine, a machine with low disk space, collaborating with people, etc. 
Using an online source allows for access anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo?
-- The way I see it, its like choosing to update an app on your phone. Yes its good practice to do so, but you can avoid it if you would like to continnue working on a specific part of the EXISTING
code without overwriting changes, or organize your files (make backups, test things, etc etc) while knowing nothign is going to change. this way you can merge with the changes you made working in your file,
so you can decide what is important later on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
-- Forks: github copy of repo to personal repo. Keeps reference back to original user
-- Clones: copy of github repo to local machine
-- Branch: git copy of repo that can move in a different direction from the master branch without affecting it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-- Good question. Hmm. I think a clear benefit is having the ability to see what the last changes to the remote are. This way you can reference the remote, knowing that at some point, it was at this current state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what woud be harder?
-- Ways to collaborate: Editing a file and then sharing, GoogleDocs (or similar service), Facebook (but similar to editing and then sharing
-- Google docs is by far the easiest solution of those listed. The other two are certainly doable, but can definitely be done quicker using other methods. Outdated, depending on context

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits deos each approach have?
-- Making changes in master is immediate, quick. Great for a project you are working on at home with no collaboration.
-- But branches are great for any time you want to make a change of some kind without affecting the end users/viewers/etc.
